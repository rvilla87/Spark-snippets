 - [Spark: Working with timestamps in a different timezone](./jupyter/spark_working_with_timestamps.ipynb): Scala notebook where we work with **timestamps** which are in a **different timezone than ours**.
 - [Spark: Working with arrays of structs](./jupyter/spark_working_arrays_structs.ipynb): Scala notebook where we load a **JSON** (inferring the schema) which has an **array of structs**, we **explode an array** and we **modify an array of structs** renaming its elements and adding a new element.
